# Maize-Disease-Detection

## Overview
This project surveys and compares various plant disease detection strategies using image processing. Given India's agricultural prominence, modern technology is crucial for enhancing farming efficiency and comfort. This project focuses on utilizing image processing and neural networks to develop an autonomous system for detecting plant diseases, specifically maize leaf disease.

## Objectives
- Survey and compare different plant disease detection strategies in the field of image processing.
- Implement an autonomous plant disease detection system using modern technologies.
- Enhance crop productivity by early detection of plant diseases.

## Importance
India is a predominantly agricultural country where agriculture serves as the primary income source for the majority of the population. Introducing modern technologies to farming can make lives more comfortable and increase crop productivity.

## Methodology
The project employs various image processing techniques and neural network approaches for plant disease detection. Specifically, it focuses on detecting maize leaf disease, which is crucial during the maize planting stage.
